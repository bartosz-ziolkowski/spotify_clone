# Spotify Clone

## Overview
With this application, I aimed to practice handling audio files while continuing to work with Java Spring Boot, Angular, and a database. Additionally, I integrated the third-party service Auth0 for OAuth 2.0 authentication. After logging in, users can upload songs, listen to them, and save them to their favorites. The application also features a search function for finding songs. Overall, the application draws inspiration from popular streaming services like Spotify, providing a similar user experience in terms of functionality and design.
